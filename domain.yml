      Throughout its history, the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences has undergone several changes. For twenty years it operated as the Vocational College of Education and Teacher Training College. In1977, when the Faculty of Industrial Education and the Teacher Training Colleges of Rijeka, Pula and Gospic merged and became a part of the University of Rijeka, the Faculty of Education was established. In 1998, the Faculty of Education was registered under the name Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.

      The mission of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences is to provide excellence in education to students in pursuit of bachelors, masters and PhD degrees in the fields of social sciences and humanities.

      In the academic year 2005/2006, the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences introduced comprehensive changes in line with the objectives defined by the Bologna Declaration, and adopted the three cycles of higher education qualification and the ECTS.
